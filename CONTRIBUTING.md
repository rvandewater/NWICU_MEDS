This repository is a **MEDS-Extract 0.7 ETL**. Almost all of it is one declarative file; there is
very little Python to change.

```bash
pip install NWICU_MEDS
export DATASET_DOWNLOAD_USERNAME=$PHYSIONET_USERNAME
export DATASET_DOWNLOAD_PASSWORD=$PHYSIONET_PASSWORD

MEDS_extract-NWICU $ROOT_OUTPUT_DIR
```

## What the 0.7 layout looks like

Under MEDS-Transforms 0.2.x an ETL was a Python package: `pre_MEDS.py` reshaped the raw data,
`dataset.yaml` described the download, `ETL.yaml` listed the pipeline stages, and
`event_configs.yaml` described the events. **0.7 replaces all four with a single MESSY file**
(MEDS-Extract Specification Syntax YAML):

| Used to be                     | Now                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataset.yaml` + `download.py` | the `sources:` block                                                      |
| `configs/ETL.yaml`             | nothing — the stage sequence is canonical and not configurable            |
| `configs/event_configs.yaml`   | the event tables, written in [dftly](https://github.com/mmcdermott/dftly) |
| `pre_MEDS.py`                  | mostly `_table.join` / `_table.cols` (see the exception below)            |

The file lives at [`src/NWICU_MEDS/messy.yaml`](src/NWICU_MEDS/messy.yaml) and is registered
under the `MEDS_extract.pipelines` entry-point group in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."MEDS_extract.pipelines"]
NWICU = "NWICU_MEDS:messy.yaml"
```

That value is **parsed, not imported** — it names a package and a data file inside it, which is
why it does not look like a normal `module:attribute` target.

## Editing the config

Three things bite newcomers, in rough order of how often:

1. **`$` is load-bearing.** `$value` reads the `value` column; a bare `value` is the string
    literal `"value"`. This fails silently — wrong data, no error.
2. **A null code component drops the row.** `f"LAB//{$item}"` discards every row with a null
    `item`. Coalesce with `?? 'UNK'` when the row must be kept. 0.6.x rendered nulls as `UNK`
    automatically; 0.7 does not.
3. **There is no null test.** dftly has no `is_null`. The working idiom is `X if $c == $c`, which
    is true for any present value (including `0`, `inf` and `NaN`) and null for a missing one.
    A bare `null` parses as the *string* `"null"`. Tracked in
    [dftly#113](https://github.com/mmcdermott/dftly/issues/113).

Also worth knowing: a table may declare **exactly one** `_table.join`, `_table.cols` entries are
evaluated in order so later ones may reference earlier ones, and adding a Duration to a Datetime
must be written as `anchor - (-$offset)::minutes` because `+` does not lower correctly.

## The one piece of Python

`MEDS_BIRTH` and `MEDS_DEATH` are per-**subject** facts, but INSPIRE records what they derive from
on `operations`, which is one row per **operation**. MESSY cannot reduce a table over its own rows
— self-joins are rejected and dftly is strictly row-wise — so
[`src/NWICU_MEDS/pre_MEDS.py`](src/NWICU_MEDS/pre_MEDS.py) reduces `operations` to one row per
subject, and the config joins that side table back.

`MEDS_extract-NWICU` chains the three steps: `meds-extract-download`, that reduction, then
`meds-extract-run`. It stages the side table in a directory of **symlinks** to the raw release, so
the checksum-verified download is never modified.

If you are porting another dataset and it needs no such reduction, drop the Python entirely and
let users call `meds-extract-run spec=<NAME>` directly.

## Testing

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest tests/
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

There is no demo release for INSPIRE, so there is no end-to-end CI test — the credentialed
download cannot run in CI. Changes that affect the output should be validated by running the ETL
over the real release and comparing cohort statistics before and after.

## Changing what the ETL emits

Any change to codes, timestamps or which rows are emitted is a change to everybody's downstream
cohort. State the measured effect in the PR — row counts, subject counts, code-vocabulary size
before and after — rather than only describing the intent. Several defects in this repository were
found precisely because those numbers were compared.

# Development

## Environment

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for its environment, lockfile,
build, and commands.

```bash
uv sync
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv run pytest
uv run mkdocs build --strict
```

A plain `pre-commit run` checks only staged files, so hooks legitimately skip
when nothing matching is staged. Use `--all-files` for a full repository check.

Build the distribution with:

```bash
uv build
```

## Release

Bump and commit the project version before creating the matching tag:

```bash
uv version --bump patch
uv run pytest
uv build --clear
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
git commit -m "Release $(uv version --short)"
VERSION=$(uv version --short)
git tag -a "$VERSION" -m "Release $VERSION"
git push origin main "$VERSION"
```

The tag workflow rejects mismatched versions, then publishes the distributions
to PyPI and creates the GitHub release.

```bash
uv sync
uv version --bump patch   # 0.0.12 → 0.0.13
uv version --bump minor   # 0.0.12 → 0.1.0
uv version --bump major   # 0.0.12 → 1.0.0
```
